Neymar started playing football as a child in So Vicente, Brazil, under the tutelage of his father, a former professional footballer who remained a close advisor and mentor to his son throughout his career. Neymar joined Portuguesa Santista's youth team in So Vicente after playing street and indoor five-a-side football, and he and his family moved to Santos in 2003. There, Neymar, a promising young player, joined Santos FC's youth academy (the same team where Brazilian football great Pel√© spent the bulk of his domestic career). He had a promising trial with Real Madrid in Spain when he was 14, and Santos had to increase its investment to keep him.
